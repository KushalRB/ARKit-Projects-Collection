# ARKit Projects Collection

Explore my Augmented Reality journey with Apple's ARKit through a collection of projects dating back to 2017. I'm currently revamping deprecated codebases and will soon upload these projects. Feel free to use them as a reference for your own AR endeavors.

ARKit was first introduced with iOS 11 on June 5 at the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference. It integrates iOS device camera and motion features to produce augmented reality. ARKit is a session based API which uses a technique called Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) to accurately track the world around it. It is compatible with A9 chips and newer (first generation iPhone SE, iPhone 6s onwards) and is designed for iOS 11 and above.
